            I’ve sailed the seven seas, and you’re the sleekest schooner I’ve
            ever sighted. It’s not everyday you get to do a pirate movie, you
            might as well go for it. Pirate’s code: First freedom and the
            captain. Second the loot, third woman and the rum and at the end no
            mercy if they not immediately surrender! A pirate is a man that is
            weak to achieve but too strong to steal from even the greatest
            achiever. Ahoy! lets trouble the water!
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, that is a hornpipe in my pocket and I am happy to see you.
            Yarrrr! there be ony two ranks of leader amongst us pirates! Captain
            and if your really notorious then it’s Cap’n! Now and then we had a
            hope that if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be
            pirates. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any
            from you. “Yes, I do heartily repent. I repent I had not done more
            mischief; and that we did not cut the throats of them that took us,
            and I am extremely sorry that you aren’t hanged as well as we. ”
            It’s not everyday you get to do a pirate movie, you might as well go
            for it.

            Yes, that is a hornpipe in my pocket and I am happy to see you. A
            pirate is a man that is weak to achieve but too strong to steal from
            even the greatest achiever. Well actually piracy is a democracy with
            captains voted for by the crew. But I am touched by y’loyalty mate.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are YOU doing here? Take what you can, give nothing back
            Suddenly you’re like a pirate, you’re 65 years old and you’ve got an
            ear- ring. Fetch me another Cabin Boy…This one be split But I am
            touched by y’loyalty mate.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s the finest pirate booty I’ve ever laid eyes on. I’ve crushed
            seventeen men’s skulls between me thighs! You can always trust the
            untrustworthy because you can always trust that they will be
            untrustworthy. Its the trustworthy you can’t trust. Not all treasure
            is silver and gold The rougher the seas, the smoother we sail. Ahoy!
            Now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God would
            permit us to be pirates. Where there is a sea there are pirates.
            It’s not everyday you get to do a pirate movie, you might as well go
            for it. Whats a pirate’s favorite fast food restaurant?
          </p>
          <p>
            Take what you can, give nothing back Give me freedom or give me the
            rope. For I shall not take the shackles that subjugate the poor to
            uphold the rich. The existence of the sea means the existence of
            pirates. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any
            from you. It’s not everyday you get to do a pirate movie, you might
            as well go for it. My mom would not let me see the pirate movie
            because it was rated rrrrr.

            Where there is a sea there are pirates. Even pirates, before they
            attack another ship, hoist a black flag. The Code is more like
            guidelines, really. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one
            and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really
            nothing but a refinement of piratical morality. Fetch me another
            Cabin Boy…This one be split Work like a captain, play like a pirate.
            Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from
            you.

            Take what you can, give nothing back And that was done without a
            single drop of rum… To err is human but to arr is pirate!! “I’ve got
            a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?”
            “Why is the rum always gone?” Damnation seize my soul if I give you
            quarters, or take any from you. It’s not everyday you get to do a
            pirate movie, you might as well go for it. Ahoy! lets trouble the
            water! Wanna shiver me timbers? Give me freedom or give me the rope.

            There comes a time in most men’s lives where they feel the need to
            raise the Black Flag. And that was done without a single drop of
            rum… Where there is a sea there are pirates. Merchant and pirate
            were for a long period one and the same person. Even today
            mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical
            morality. Right from the Voyage og Noah, surviving was by sailing.
            Avast ye! and sail against the tides.
